# Royalties

This is a module that contains functions for parsing and processing royalty reports. We are getting reports from Spotify and INAudio in .xlsx format. Each report is converted into a dataclass object and later they are pushed to bigquery.

## Running tests

```bash
python3 -m unittest -v
```
